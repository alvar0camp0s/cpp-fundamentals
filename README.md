## Introduction
I am a Computer Engineering student at Universidad Centroamericana JosÃ© SimeÃ³n CaÃ±as (UCA) ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡». This repository is part of my personal learning path to master C++ and enhance my problem-solving skills. You will find a collection of practice problems, coding challenges, and project implementations here.

## Learning Goals
- Master C++ syntax and structure
- Solve algorithmic problems efficiently
- Understand data structures and object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Develop small applications to practice C++ concepts

## Exercises
Below are some examples of what you'll find in this repository:
- Basic syntax exercises
- Arrays and loops problems
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to any of the exercises or suggest improvements! If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
